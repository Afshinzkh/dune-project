Notes for installing the Dune Course 2016:

- You need a Linux distribution with a recent compiler (GCC 5 recommended, GCC 4.9 might work).
  We use Fedora 23.

- You need the following packages installed: gcc, g++, gfortran, cmake (at least cmake 3.2), make, MPI, texlive-full,
  gnuplot, doxygen, graphviz, paraview (for visualization), inkscape, blas, lapack, gmp, superlu

  (Hopefully this list is exhaustive).
  For all of the libraries like MPI, blas etc. you also need the -devel packages with the headers.

- Clone the Git repository for the course by entering the command: git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/dune-course/iwr-course-2016.git
- Enter the iwr-course-2016 directory
- Run ./install.sh
- The script will build a debug and a release version of the modules into the subdirectories release-build/ and
  debug-build/
- The actual sources are in dune/
- The documentation of the tutorials can be found in release-build/dune-pdelab-tutorials/tutorial*/doc
- The source code of the tutorials can be found in release-build/dune-pdelab-tutorials/tutorial*/src
